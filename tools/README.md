# Host Tools

## Included Support Files

- [`programming/jlink/hc32f448/`](programming/jlink/hc32f448/): HC32F448 J-Link device XML and 128/256 KiB Flash Algorithms.
- [`uart/`](uart/): ATK-XCOM-compatible UART settings and download policy.
- [`can/`](can/): CAN adapter setup, vendor-tool links, and the supported project workflow.

The current Python utilities remain in the repository root to preserve existing invocation paths:

- `can_trans.py`: sends MIT commands through a Damiao USB-CAN adapter, waits for ACKs, and listens for frames;
- `can_code_control_test.py`: sends a sequence of output-shaft angles;

As the toolset grows, utilities may move into this directory while retaining backward-compatible entry points.
